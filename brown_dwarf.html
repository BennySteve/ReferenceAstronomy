<h2>Brown Dwarf</h2>
<img src="img/browndwarf.jpeg">
<p>Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen (1H) into helium in their cores, unlike a main-sequence star. Instead, they have a mass between the most massive gas giant planets and the least massive stars, approximately 13 to 80 times that of Jupiter (MJ).[2][3] However, they can fuse deuterium (2H), and the most massive ones (> 65 MJ) can fuse lithium (7Li).[3]
Though their existence was initially theorized in the 1960s, it was not until the mid-1990s that the first unambiguous brown dwarfs were discovered. As brown dwarfs have relatively low surface temperatures, they are not very bright at visible wavelengths, emitting most of their light in the infrared. However, with the advent of more capable infrared detecting devices, thousands of brown dwarfs have been identified. The nearest-known brown dwarfs are located in the Luhman 16 system, a binary of L- and T-type brown dwarfs at about 6.5 light-years (2.0 parsecs). Luhman 16 is the third closest system to the Sun after Alpha Centauri and Barnard's Star.
